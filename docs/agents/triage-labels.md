# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

In this repo, issues live as local markdown. These strings are **tags on ticket files** (a `Status:` line near the top of each `.scratch/<feature>/issues/*.md` file), not GitHub labels. Do not create GitHub labels for them.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding string from this table as the ticket's `Status:` value.

Edit the "Label in our tracker" column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.
